# Kiosk P.S. 1 Exhibit

This app is deployed thru [Heroku](http://kioskkiosk.herokuapp.com/)

### To get up and running...
```
npm install
node index.js
```
However, that will only let you test xml responses when you manually input data similar to Twilio requests.
You will need to use heroku to set you up locally.

```
heroku local web
```
